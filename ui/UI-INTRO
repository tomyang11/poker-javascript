To view the UI:
cd ui
npm start

App.js is the main UI page, so take a look at that one. 

Under the title you'll see several hands, the board, and the dealer chip. I've created the necessary UI components, now it's
just a matter of positioning them on the page.

Every card is represeted by a React component structured like <Card name="4_of_clubs" />

I pretty much just have to handle the money situation now, not sure what we want for UI there.

Every component has its own CSS file
